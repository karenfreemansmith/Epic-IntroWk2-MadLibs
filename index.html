        <h1>The Golden <span class="animal"></span></h1>
        <p>
          There was once a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful <span class="animal"></span> you can imagine, for every day when he visited the nest, the <span class="animal"></span> had laid a beautiful, glittering, golden <span class="food"></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Countryman took the <span class="food"></span>s to market and soon began to get rich. But it was not long before he grew impatient with the <span class="animal"></span> because she gave him only a single golden <span class="food"></span> a day. He was not getting rich fast enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then one day, after he had finished counting his money, the idea came to him that he could get all the golden <span class="food"></span>s at once by killing the <span class="animal"></span> and cutting it open. But when the deed was done, not a single golden <span class="food"></span> did he find, and his precious <span class="animal"></span> was dead.
